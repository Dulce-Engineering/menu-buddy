  "description": "JavaScript Web Component for displaying iPod-like sliding menus. No dependencies. This form of sliding menu allows for infinitely nested menu structures that can still be displayed within a confined rendering area. Great for situations where you want to provide a minimalist UI that still allows for access to many functionality options. Menu Buddy can be used to render always-on navigation bar menus, drop-down menus, or customised as needed.",
